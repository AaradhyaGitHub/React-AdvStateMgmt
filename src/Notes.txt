Component Composition helps but not always 

Intro To React's Context API 
- Built into React 
- Data Sharing is simplified across components 

The Main Idea: 
- Create a context value 
- and you wrap this context around multiple components maybe even all components 
- Can be easily connected to the state 
- Eliminates props, passing states/ state updating functions
